		About Me..!
	</h1>
	<p>
		A lot of what I cook everyday are inspired by something I’ve eaten on my travels or at a restaurant which made a particular impression on me.

My most recent favourite is stuffed roasted peppers. I’ve had different versions of it from Spanish pimientos del piquillo to oven baked green peppers stuffed with minced meat in India.
	</p>
	<p>
		I never attempted to make them because it seemed rather painstaking to roast and skin peppers, and buying the tinned version isn’t something I did because I never buy tinned vegetables. Must be a habit from growing up in a country, which grows vegetables all year round.

However recipes that I like but haven’t tried myself always leave me with this niggling feeling of not having done something!

		So, last night, I gave in to the temptation while watching Jamie Oliver cooking his famous 30 minute meals. The minute inspiration struck I abandoned Jamie. He rambled on about the rest of his awesome Morroccan feast.
